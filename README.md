The dev page for android camera helped me implement my bonus feature.

To use the app just load a photo and select a brush type to begin painting! The camera button allows to user to take a photo to be painted. There is also a toggle color button which toggles between normal color and complementary. In complementary colors mode the impressionist painter will paint the opposite color on the color wheel of what's on the original photo.
